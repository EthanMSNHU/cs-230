Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  Our client is The Gaming room and they currently had a game called draw it or lose it that was created for android systems. The client wanted to expand their
  game to multiple platforms: Linux, Mac, Windows and mobile platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  This class for me has been a little rough all the way around from comprehending the material to applying the material learned. I tried my hardest to be able to
  do the assignments correctly but most of them I did not. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I think understanding the requirements  and design constraints portion helped me develop the code for a finer more solid version of the application.  

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would like to revise the project 3 portion of the gaming room document because I did the assignment while not having 
  the full understanding of the meaning of the questions due to my lack of knowledge. I just went through the motions for 
  that assignment. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   I took the needs of the user from the original application and applied them to the new version of the application that the client wanted. I wanted to ensure that 
  When the new version of our client's game came out, the users still experienced the same game with the same qualities and attributes and function. If the client is
  happy but the users are not then there is no profit and this can lead to users no longer using any product from our client in the future

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  The main focus of this project was to meet all of the clients and users needs for the application all while providing the best documentation possible. With that 
  extensive documentation it allows for either my future self or future developers returning to the code to get caught up to speed and know everything I knew at the 
  time of development. Hopefully there would be no unanswered questions for a smooth transition from developer to developer. Or in some cases for the client to see how 
  We went about making their application to reference other developers for future applications they wish to make.
